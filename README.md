🌱 Smart Aeroponics System
📌 Project Description

The Smart Aeroponics System is an IoT-based smart farming solution that enables soil-less plant cultivation using nutrient-rich mist. The system uses real-time sensor monitoring, ESP32-based automation, and AI/ML-assisted prediction to maintain optimal plant growth conditions while reducing water and nutrient usage.

This project is designed for sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and precision-controlled plant growth environments.
